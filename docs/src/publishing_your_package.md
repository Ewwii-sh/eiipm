# Publishing Your Package

Created a package for Ewwii and want it to be easily installable via **eiipm**? That’s fantastic! By publishing your package to **eii-manifests**, you make it instantly accessible to the entire Ewwii community, letting users install it with a single command.

Eiipm pulls all package metadata directly from **eii-manifests**, so the first step is to register your package there. This ensures that your package is correctly tracked, built, and installed for everyone. Once registered, users can seamlessly download, build (if necessary), and use your package without worrying about paths, dependencies, or manual setup.

Check out the [Adding Your Package to Manifests guide](https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/eii-manifests?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-your-package-to-manifests) for a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough. Following the guide will help you structure your package correctly, define its metadata, and make sure it installs smoothly for all users.

Publishing isn’t just about sharing code. It’s about contributing to a growing ecosystem. So take the leap, add your package, and become a part of the Ewwii community!
